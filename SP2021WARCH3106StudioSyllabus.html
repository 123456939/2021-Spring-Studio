<strong>INTRODUCTION:</strong>
</p>
<p>
This is an ambitious studio looking at the ground up or purpose-built Capital
city intended to be a traveling studio. Due to the global pandemic (even with
the situation relatively under control in China), we have been limited in our
ability to travel to any notable extent. As an opportunity to look beyond the
physical world to travel - we have resorted to virtual travel. In turn we will
be resorting to virtual explorations, and thus documentation as an outlet for
our creative efforts.
</p>
<p>
Even the cliche statement: “form follows function” still holds significant merit
due to the fact that it is almost futile attempting to consider form with the
challenges of the function demanding consideration. It is for this reason that a
large focus will be put on technical aspects of the city. For example one key
element of focus for the studio is the mundane need to integrate housing into
the solution set for any urban condition. Yet these are not the only technical
aspects we are interested in covering. Conceptions such as Arcology or more
concrete instantiations such as Mazdar have taken on the impact of human
development on “spaceship earth”. Thus sustainability will be an important part
of the studios objectives and foci.
</p>
<p>
We will be considering historic, technical, and theoretical aspects of purpose
built cities. Throughout time many cities have been premeditated, purpose built,
planned cities. As we live with globalization and rural flight, we are seeing
much more of a precedent for ground up, purpose built or planned cities;
particularly in Asia and China. We have seen ‘Special Economic Zones’ announced
throughout the recent past. Some of these have been less successful than others,
yet we do see the overwhelming and unignorable successes of others, such as
Shenzhen, etc. But China also has a long history of emperor decreed cities
rising out of a designated plot of land, and China is not alone in this act. For
example, recently we have seen several successful examples in the Middle East,
including the current effort in Egypt (The new administrative capital).
</p>
<p>
Yet when considering purpose built cities, should we only consider built ones?
Can we expand our definition of ‘city’? Looking at the origin of the word: “from
Old French cite, from Latin civitas, from civis ‘citizen’.” Does a citizen have
to only be human? How about a termite mound? Does it have citizens, a video
game, or cellular automata?
</p>
<p>
Much of what drives design are performative aspects of the outcomes, yet if we
are only driven by the utilitarian requirements, we will never allow ourselves
the opportunity to imagine alternatives. By pushing beyond what is possible we
enable new possibilities for the future. This can be referred to as the
development of possible futures. This studio builds on the heritage of the
digital studios pioneered by Bernard Tschumi. We see the legacy of that effort
going on to create such projects as the digital Guggenheim, New City, and has
even influenced Hollywood world building see examples from Alex McDowell and the
World Building Media Lab at the University of Southern California. Yet this is
not the only lineage of computation influencing the future of urban conceptions.
We have seen, particularly in the last ten years, the influence of computational
methods such as parametric, procedural, and machine learning rework the
possibilities of creativity to incorporate computation as a collaborator. Beyond
those technical aspects driving creativity and innovation there are other
stirrings including more cultural ones such as the post-digital movement which
has worked to flatten and colorize predominant conceptions of our future.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<strong>QUESTIONS TO KEEP IN MIND INCLUDE:</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>What kind of a world would you like to exist in if some limitation was
removed?
<li>What possible futures which could embody a more sustainable situation for
humanity?
<li>What is the ideal community for an individual? For the industry? For the
community?
<li>What elements are needed in order to cultivate the most conducive
environments?
<li>What methods of digital representation are optimal for expressing your
ideas?
<li>How can one question traditional typologies and outdated organizational
systems?
<li>How do diverse family structures, demographics, and living/working styles
affect the city?
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<strong>FUNCTIONAL SPACE REQUIREMENTS:</strong>
</p>
<p>
Instead of predefining traditional programmatic areas, students will begin by
examining and capturing the rituals, priorities, and everyday life of the
individuals who would live there.
</p>
<p>
Projects are expected to propose concepts of sharing and equity that incorporate
community beyond a simple solution for office space, while speculating on
functional space requirements and their potential configurations. At a minimum,
spaces, either indoor or outdoor, should include some method of delineating
programmatic spaces in the city.
</p>
<p>
Projects should be a series of experiential moments expressed through
architectural means. This may include: a network of multiple buildings, a
re-purposing of existing buildings and infrastructure throughout the site zone,
possible futures.

<p>
<strong>DELIVERABLES:</strong>
</p>
<p>
The studio seeks to allow for experimentation regarding both the content and the
presentation of your work. With the internet continually moving further into
ubiquity we seek for a digital presence from this studio. As a part of the
complimentary representation course we will be exploring with different novel
methods of representing architectural work. As we explore, it will become clear
which methods are most compelling / successful. We imagine that those methods
will become more heavily leaned upon for the key reviews of the work. Our
intention is that the studio will leave behind an archeological record of your
best work. Thus you will be required to maintain your own github webspace for
the entirety of the course. That space will be evaluated periodically at key
moments throughout the semester.
</p>
<p>
The studio will evaluate 3 main final studio deliverables
</p>
<p>
(MJ = Midterm Jury Deliverable  |  FJ = Final Jury Deliverable):
</p>
<ol>
<li>DIGITAL PRESENTATION CURATED ON YOUR WEB SPACE (or other digital media
forms):
<li>Historic Research integration into the project MJ/FJ
<li>Technical Research integration into the project MJ/FJ
<li>Theoretical Research integration into the project MJ/FJ
<li>Precedent Examples MJ/FJ
<li>Process documentation MJ/FJ
<li>Experiential Storyboard MJ/FJ
<li>Design Proposal Statement (150 words max.) MJ/FJ
<li>(5/10) Primary Perspectives MJ/FJ
<li>Circulation Diagrams FJ
<li>Program Diagrams FJ
<li>Zoning representation FJ
<li>Sectional Views FJ
<li>Axonometric views illustrating key architectural concepts FJ
<li>8-10-minute digital presentation FJ
</li>
</ol>
<p>
2.  FINAL BOOK SPREADS
</p>
<p>
You will be required to produce a maximum of two B5 size spreads for the school
wide portfolio
</p>
<p>

<strong>STUDIO REQUIREMENTS/POLICIES:</strong>
</p>
<p>
1. Attend class and reviews on time and participate in discussions. Arriving
more than fifteen minutes late or leaving more than 15 minutes early is recorded
as an absence. Unexcused absences will affect your Final Grade (three or more
will result in a failing grade for the course).
</p>
<p>
2. Adhere to the Studio Culture Policy of the School of Architecture, which
emphasizes creative thinking, ethical behavior and personal commitment.
</p>
<p>
3. Develop the design project weekly through sketches, drawings, physical
models, diagrams, renderings, and other representation techniques; read assigned
texts and complete assignments on time.
</p>
<p>
4. Attendance at all Field Trips is Mandatory. All students should come fully
prepared for each Field Trip with
</p>
<p>
materials to produce the analysis and documentation for each site visit.
</p>
<p>
5. Participation in the Thinking Creatively Workshops/Mini-Conference are both
mandatory and counted as
</p>
<p>
part of a student’s overall Grade.
</p>
<p>
6. The assumption is made that all students will strive to acquire a mastery of
each assignment. If the work
</p>
<p>
produced by a student is deemed unsatisfactory, that student will be required to
“re-do” the assignment as is necessary until its mastery is achieved. The
student will then be invited to commence work on the next
</p>
<p>
assignment.
</p>
<p>
7. Produce all required deliverables to a high level of resolution for each
Weekly Pin Up/Review and for both
</p>
<p>
the Midterm collection of work for evaluation and the Final Review; failure to
submit work for Midterm
</p>
<p>
evaluation or to attend the Final Review on time, with the completed required
deliverables, will result in a
</p>
<p>
failing grade.
</p>
<p>
8. No mobile device/tablet/laptop use allowed during Studio Class Meeting time,
except for Studio Work.
</p>
<p>
Violations will incur impoundment of offending devices and/or dismissal from the
Studio session.
</p>
<p>
9. Appropriate behavior is expected of all students while in Studio. Any
inappropriate behavior will result in
</p>
<p>
a student being asked to leave the Studio session.
</p>
<p>
