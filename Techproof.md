If you are trying to display objects (not an environment) try a tool such as [Spline Design](https://spline.design/)

Or if you are trying to display an environment try a photosphere export from your 3D modeling software try using something like [Pannellum](https://pannellum.org) they have a simple utility for viewing creating them [here](https://pannellum.org/documentation/overview/tutorial/)
