## Virtual Traveling Studio - [The Purpose-built Capital](https://en.tempo.co/read/1234359/7-capital-cities-that-were-built-from-scratch)

[![Complex urban fabric](https://github.com/steenblikrs/2021-Spring-Studio/blob/main/substrateBW1000.jpg?raw=true "Complex Urban Fabric")]()

This is an ambitious studio looking at the ground up or purpose-built Capital city. This is intended to be a traveling studio. Due to the global pandemic (even with the situation relatively under control), we have been limited on our ability to travel to any notable extent. As an opportunity to opportunity to look beyond the physical world for opportunities to travel - we have resorted to virtual travel. In turn we will be resorting to virtual explorations, and thus documentation as an outlet for our creative efforts. With this in mind please find the information below as a reference:

 

### Purpose-built Capitals

**China:**

The Great Capital Cities of China:

Xian, Luoyang, Nanjing, Beijing, Xiong'an? The JJJ [(Jing-Jin-Ji)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jing-Jin-Ji) Economic zone.

**Other Capitals to consider** [(see wiki list exhaustive list)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_purpose-built_national_capitals)

### Technology Proof of Concepts

(to be removed after use)

Here is a proof of concept of some of the technologies I hope you can use during the semester.

If you are trying to display an environment try a photosphere export from your 3D modeling software try using something like [Pannellum](https://pannellum.org) they have a simple utility for viewing creating them [here](https://pannellum.org/documentation/overview/tutorial/)

Or if you are trying to display objects (not an environment) try a tool such as [Spline Design](https://spline.design/)





### Samples Markdown for your reference




You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/steenblikrs/2021-Spring-Studio/edit/gh-pages/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3

- Bulleted
- List

1. Numbered
2. List

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)
```

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/steenblikrs/2021-Spring-Studio/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
