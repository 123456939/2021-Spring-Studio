This is an ambitious studio looking at the ground up or purpose-built Capital city. This is intended to be a traveling studio. Due to the global pandemic (even with the situation relatively under control), we have been limited on our ability to travel to any notable extent. As an opportunity to opportunity to look beyond the physical world for opportunities to travel - we have resorted to virtual travel. In turn we will be resorting to virtual explorations, and thus documentation as an outlet for our creative efforts. With this in mind please find the information below as a reference:

 

### Purpose-built Cities or Capitals

**China:**

The Great Capital Cities of China:

Xian, Luoyang, Nanjing, Beijing, Xiong'an? The JJJ [(Jing-Jin-Ji)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jing-Jin-Ji) Economic zone.

**Other Capitals to consider** [(see wiki for exhaustive list)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_purpose-built_national_capitals)

possibly a conceptual city of your choice (refer to Graham's Lecture)

### Theoretical Aspects of the City

[The why factory](https://thewhyfactory.com/project/)

### Technical Aspects of the City

[See the wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_aspects_of_urban_planning)

### Technology Proof of Concepts

If you are trying to display an environment try a photosphere export from your 3D modeling software try using something like [Pannellum](https://pannellum.org) they have a simple utility for viewing creating them [here](https://pannellum.org/documentation/overview/tutorial/)

Or if you are trying to display objects (not an environment) try a tool such as [Spline Design](https://spline.design/) If you click on [this](https://my.spline.design/untitled-698fdc3c510a9737202576ebe15c34bf/) link you can view it full screen on your phone
